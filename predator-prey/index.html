        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Observe the relationship between the populations of owls (predators) and mice (prey).</p>
        
        <h2>The Simulation</h2>
        <script>var game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'gameContainer', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });</script>
        <div id="gameContainer"></div>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>An owl needs to eat three mice to survive. The owl can only catch mice that its image overlaps. For each three mice it eats, it has one baby. One owl will have at most three babies. If the owl starves (eats less than three mice), a baby owl will move into the area from elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Any mice that are not eaten will breed. The population of mice doubles each time they bread. However, the area has a maximum population it can support. If the mice population exceeds this maximum, it is reduced by half. The mimimum number of mice in the area is three, if it is less more mice will move in from elsewhere.</p>
